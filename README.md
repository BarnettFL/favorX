# FavorX - Readme

## 1 Introduction

FavorX is an underlying layer for decentralized storage and content distraction used by the application - FavorTube, which is also an application module on the FavorX protocol stack. FavorX implements a complete protocol stack of different functional modules from the base blockchain to the applications, and the complete decentralization for file storage, content distribution, data retrieval, and purchase transactions.

## 2 Usage

As the first decentralized application of FavorX, FavorTube is directly connected to the blockchain on the mobile terminal via P2P networks and is the first fully decentralized application project that supports the implementation of the mobile terminal. FavorTube implements the first decentralized streaming media content creation platform with commercial capabilities through the multi-layer decentralized protocol stack FavorX, and FavorX provides decentralized storage and content distribution for FavorTube.

FavorTube adds the dedicated protocols and smart contracts required by itself to the FavorX protocol stack, implementing a completely decentralized content creation platform. Since FavorTube is based on the basic protocol stack of FavorX, file transfers are carried out through FavorX, and the files may be transferred in segments.

In FavorX, the TPS of storage matching and content distribution subchain is 1000 with 16 shards, while the TPS of the decentralized database is 2000 with only one shard. The FavorTube protocol layer contains the protocol interface between the FavorTube applications and the FavorX base chains and subchains. Since FavorX is a decentralized system, FavorTube does not have ownership of the data, which belongs to the creators on FavorTube, while any application can use the FavorTube protocol to access the data on FavorX, thereby completing its own FavorTube implementation.

## 3 Installation

To start a FavorX node, you can download FavorX, build the FavorX executable files, launch FavorX, and make some important configurations of FavorX. 

For detailed information on installation, please refer to the following web pages:

## 4 Configuration

After the installation of FavorX is complete, if the configuration is not filled in properly, the accounting function may not work properly. In order to get the node up and running properly during the pre-testnet phase, please ensure that the configuration is correct.
